    <h3>  Take risks </h3>
    <p> Four days ago I bought the flight tickets to attend my first ever hackathon, the same day of my application which literally closed the next day. Why didn't I applied earlier? though I wasn't prepared enough. The hackathon started the next day. </p>
    <p> Today I come back home as a winner of two prizes, met an amazing team and learned alot about them. The best part; it inspired me to keep going with my personal goals.</p>
    <p> I used to prepare myself very hard in order to reduce failure %. It took me a lot of years to realize it wasn't the right approach. Preparing too much is useless if there is never real problem exposure. </p>
    <p> The best way to learn and prepare is by doing. School, courses & programs are ok, but they could falsely make you believe you are learning. There isn't a book, guide or pre-fabricated way to become an expert on a field. </p>
    <p> Do. Just do it. Try building the product/project/goal you want. In struggling is were the human brain really learns. Google it, ask mentors & friends or just read online blogs about it but take action. If you could just take one thing from this blog, make it the following: try building what you want no matter how hard it looks.  </p>
